# AI-Casino Repository

AI-Casino is a minimal repository containing a simple list of planned casino games.

## Current Repository Structure

This repository currently contains only:
- `Games` - A text file listing "poker, blackjack and roulette"
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - This instruction file

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd /home/runner/work/AI-Casino/AI-Casino

# View repository contents
ls -la
# Expected output: Shows .git/, .github/, and Games file

# View planned games
cat Games
# Expected output: "poker, blackjack and roulette"
```

## Repository Status

- **Current state**: Early planning phase with single Games file
- **No build system**: No package.json, Makefile, or build scripts
- **No code**: No implementation files yet
- **No tests**: No testing framework or test files
- **No dependencies**: No external packages or libraries

## Working with This Repository

Since this is a minimal planning repository:

1. **View contents**: Use `cat Games` to see planned casino games
2. **Check history**: Use `git log --oneline` to see commit history  
3. **Make changes**: Edit the `Games` file or add new files as needed
4. **No installation needed**: Repository works immediately after cloning

## Future Development

When ready to implement the casino games, consider:
- Choose a programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Add project structure (`src/`, `tests/`, etc.)
- Implement individual games (poker, blackjack, roulette)
- Add build system and dependencies as needed
